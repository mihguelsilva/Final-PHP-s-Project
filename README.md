# Final Project in PHP

This project has intention to demonstrate my PHP's skills through the
course which I've been studying on. For a while, I've gain habilities
in PHP's proggraming language. However, it isn't the first time which
I interact with proggraming in my life, considering the amount of
years which I've been working with *NodeJS*, *Shell Script*,
*JavaScript* and *Python*.

## Database

In this project, which is extension of the course which I've been
studying from, we've learned to work my *MySQL/MariaDB* database,
which will consequentently be the database on which we'll work on.

In this course, not only to input code into MariaDB's database, but
modeling data too, since it's an important step in database's
construction.

## Goal

PHP's final project has the goal to use LAMP with HTML5 and CSS. Once
site become's ready to use, then I can demonstrate my LAMP's skills,
so I can affort new job's opportunities.
